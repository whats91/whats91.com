## 🔁 GitHub Auto-Deploy Webhook

A secure webhook endpoint is available at `POST /api/webhooks/github` for pull/build/restart automation.

### Behavior
- Verifies `X-Hub-Signature-256` with `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET` (required).
- Handles `ping` and `push` GitHub webhook events.
- Can be scoped to one branch via `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_BRANCH` (if unset, any branch push is accepted).
- Runs commands in order:
  1. `git pull`
  2. `bun install` (enabled by default)
  3. `bun run build` (enabled by default)
  4. `pm2 restart <process>` (defaults to `all`)

### Environment variables

```bash
# required: used to verify X-Hub-Signature-256
GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_webhook_secret

# optional: if set, only pushes to this branch trigger deployment
GITHUB_WEBHOOK_BRANCH=main

# optional: path to the repository/app directory to run commands in
GITHUB_WEBHOOK_PROJECT_PATH=C:/path/to/whats91.com

# optional: PM2 process name, defaults to "all"
PM2_PROCESS_NAME=whats91

# optional toggles, defaults are true
GITHUB_WEBHOOK_RUN_BUN_INSTALL=true
GITHUB_WEBHOOK_RUN_BUN_BUILD=true
```

### Notes for Windows
- Command execution uses Node.js `child_process.exec`, so standard globally available CLI tools (`git`, `bun`, `pm2`) must be available in PATH.
- Keep this endpoint private and protected by the secret signature.
